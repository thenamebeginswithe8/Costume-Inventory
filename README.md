# Costume Logistics App (Vite + React + Tailwind)

Quick start:

1. Install Node.js (LTS) from https://nodejs.org/
2. In the project folder run:
   ```
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open the local URL shown by Vite (e.g. http://localhost:5173)

This project uses TailwindCSS. Follow the earlier instructions if you want to re-run Tailwind setup; the project already includes minimal Tailwind config files.
